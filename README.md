Test task
The following task is quite tough because it covers many areas of web
development.
It's not about experience, it's rather about ability to solve complex tasks.

Please develop an online web browser which will blur faces on all images
as Google Street View does.
The technical implementation is not restricted by time, so you can focus
on the project quality.
As a result, you will need to provide us with link to the sources
repository, link to the workable application as well as application
deployment guide.
